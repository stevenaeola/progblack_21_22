## Task summary

- Construct a dynamic web site for an application of your choosing
- Use static HTML pages loading dynamic JSON content from server via AJAX
- Server written in nodejs to provide JSON through REST API

---

## Dynamic web site

- Choose any application domain as long as it includes at least two kinds of entity e.g.
  - pictures
  - people
  - places
  - events
  - comments
- Could be e.g. club, social, health, gallery
- If you are not sure then ask me

---

## Static HTML loading JSON via AJAX

- 'Single page app': page content loaded as JSON via AJAX
- Can have more than one page e.g. for user and admin
- Should provide clean and simple User Experience (UX)
- Should be responsive i.e. work well on desktop and mobile
- Recommend using framework such as Bootstrap, semantic-ui

---

## Server provides JSON through a REST API

Each entity type (e.g. picture) has 

- GET method to list/search (returns a list of ids and names)
- GET method for individual details (includes details of related entities)
- POST method to add new entity
- Document your API in the style of the [Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/api-reference-index)

---

- Response provided as JSON
- Content-type needs to be correct
- HTTP codes should be correct: use 200, 400 or 403 (if using authentication)

---

## Server written in nodejs

- Use npm for management
- Make sure you use --save or --save-dev option with packages you add
- Write jest test cases: run with `npm test`
- Use eslint: run with `npm run pretest`
- Recommend using express

---

## Submission

Source code (all zipped)

- HTML and CSS and any media
- Client and server side JavaScript
- package.json including test and pretest scripts
- .eslintrc 
- jest test cases e.g. app.test.js
- documentation of API
- demonstration video 

Should not include `node_modules` in submission

---

## Assessment Criteria

Equally weighted 9% each

- Client-side functionality
- Client-side quality
- Server-side functionality
- Server-side quality
- Video presentation

---

## Client-side functionality criteria

- User Experience (UX): clean layout and minimal clicks/entry required
- App complexity: entities can be listed and edited
- 'Single page' style: asynchronous updates
- Staff reviewed

---

## Client-side quality criteria

- Standards compliant (HTML5)
- Responsive to different viewport sizes
- Gracefully handles server disconnection
  - useful error messages
  - recommences on server restart
- Peer reviewed; staff moderated

---

## Server-side functionality criteria

- More than one entity type, with relationships
- REST API provides each entity with appropriate GET/POST methods
- Installs with `npm install`
- Starts with `npm start`
- Staff reviewed

---

## Server-side quality criteria

- Successful eslint (run with `npm run pretest`)
- Successful jest tests with good coverage (run with `npm test`)
- Testing includes content-type and HTTP code
- Completeness of API documentation 
- Peer reviewed; staff moderated

---

## Video Presentation

- Submit a 2 minute (max) video demonstrating your software
- Include demonstration of how to start the program
- All functionality will be assessed by what is demonstrated in the video
- If it is not demonstrated in the video, you will not get a mark for it
- Quality of video presentation will be marked separately from functionality:
  - Structure; Visual Presentation; Audio explanation
- Lose 10% of marks for every 10 seconds over 2 minutes
- Staff reviewed

---

## Peer Review Marking

5% of the module marks are awarded for peer assessment

* 2 marks for completion of four peer reviews
* 3 marks for the accuracy of the reviews
* Accuracy is based on agreement with peers
* Accuracy marks deducted for being over-harsh and over-generous
* The average student tends to get about 65%
* 65% is on the good/very good boundary of the [marking conventions](https://www.dur.ac.uk/resources/university.calendar/volumeii/2021.2022/coreregsug.pdf) p15
